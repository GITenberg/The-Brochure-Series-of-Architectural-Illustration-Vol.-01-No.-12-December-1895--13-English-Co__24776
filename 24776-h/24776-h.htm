OLD HOUSE NEAR WARWICK. SKETCH BY WILSON EYRE, Jr.<br>
From The Architectural Review, Vol. IV, No. 1.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "dropcap">M</span><span class = "firstword">r Wilson Eyre,
Jr.</span>, in an article in <i>The Architectural Review</i> for
January, which has been alluded to in our issue for October, and from
which we have borrowed the three charming illustrations reproduced from
his drawings, speaks as follows of English domestic architecture:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is much to be seen from the railroad in the way of long
rambling farmhouses and country houses of the modest kind, and there is
much to be gained by studying these for use in our own domestic
architecture; their average work is so much less pretentious, so much
more homelike than ours; their surroundings are studied so carefully,
the garden forming as much part of the house as the roof, and great
pains being taken that the garden wall, hedges, terraces, the little tea
houses, in fact all the immediate surroundings, should form a harmonious
effect. Photographs and measured drawings of the well-known and
monumental buildings are at hand whenever we need them, but no idea can
be gained, except from personal study, of the completeness and fitness
of the country houses and farmhouses and of their surroundings, their
&ldquo;flocks of gables,&rdquo; the grouping and
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<!-- png13 -->
composition which through the most careful study arrive at the entirely
unstudied and almost haphazard effect, and above all the impression
produced that the building belongs to the spot upon which it is built
and to no other. This is what makes the English domestic work better, to
my mind, than any I have seen, and so well worthy of study, especially
by our American architects.&rdquo;</p>

OLD HOUSE, LICHFIELD.<br>
SKETCH BY WILSON EYRE, Esq.<br>
From The Architectural Review, Vol. IV, No. 1.</p>

<p>The one distinguishing characteristic upon which all observers agree
when comparing the houses of England with those of any other country is
the importance given to the idea of a &ldquo;home.&rdquo; This idea of
the family life, more fully carried out by the Anglo-Saxon race than by
any other, has given rise to conditions differing essentially from those
governing the domestic architecture of other races. As pointed out in
the last issue in speaking of the country houses of France, the impulse
to associate in communities has been a stronger power in moulding the
domestic architecture of France than the desire to have an independent
home. In England the isolated house is the type. The social unit is the
family, and consequently the architectural unit is the
&ldquo;home.&rdquo; The English character has given to the family an
independence and privacy, a&nbsp;permanence and sacredness which are all
reflected in the English houses, and it is this which makes them homes.
The evidence of these characteristics is what has attracted Mr. Eyre and
many other Americans besides, and will continue to do so for years to
come.</p>

CHAPEL, DEERHURST.<br>
SKETCH BY WILSON EYRE, Jr.<br>
From The Architectural Review, Vol. IV, No. 1.</p>

<p>English architecture is not all and never has been all of the sort
here indicated, but where it departs from this type we feel the peculiar
charm somewhat lacking. The early Saxon hut, the Norman castle, have
each their especial interest, and we feel that the home has culminated
in the Elizabethan and Tudor mansions and the simpler homes of later
days which are adjusted to the needs of the family and suited to its
surroundings,
<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
<!-- png15 -->
because built honestly with due regard to the necessities, and even if,
as Ruskin says, their detail is abominable and there is no precedent, no
right nor reason in the square drip moulding over the windows, yet we
love them as a whole, and cannot help feeling that they expressed truly
the story they were intended to tell. But we do not feel the same
instinctive attraction in the Palladian mansions of Jones, however
accurately classical are their proportions or their mouldings, nor in
any other of the dignified importations transplanted from Greece or Rome
and forced to grow on uncongenial soil. They must ever be to us exotics,
with perhaps the beauty of the exotic, but without the homely qualities
which endear to us the real home.</p>

<h4>Club Notes.</h4>

<hr class = "micro">

<p>Nearly simultaneously with the announcement that the T Square Club,
of Philadelphia, has been awarded the
<!-- 191b -->
<!-- png16 -->
medal offered by the St. Louis Architectural Club for the best
Club-exhibit of Mention Designs comes the news of John
Stewardson&rsquo;s lamentable death. As a founder of the Club, as its
president, and for years a member of its Executive Committee, he
remained to the last one of its most enthusiastic supporters. Many of
his drawings are now in the Club rooms, and his record as the winner of
many competitions is upon the minutes of the Club.</p>

<p>His generous aid, sincere criticism, and deep interest in the welfare
of the Club contributed more to the advancement of architecture in
Philadelphia than can now be realized.</p>

<p class = "space">
The ninth annual Exhibition of the Chicago Architectural Club will be
held at the Art Institute, Chicago, opening March 27, 1896.</p>

<p>This exhibition will include architectural drawings and perspectives
in all renderings, scale, details of public and private work, <ins class

drawings of parks and other public improvements, works of sculpture and
artistic exhibits of works of the allied arts.</p>

blanks can be had by addressing Frank M. Garden, Secretary, Chicago
Architectural Club, 274 Michigan Ave., Chicago.</p>

In the seventh annual competition for the Robert Clark testimonials,
held under the auspices of the Chicago Architectural Club, the prize
winners are as follows: Addison B. Le Boutillier, Boston, Mass., gold
medal; William Leslie Welton, Lynn, Mass., silver medal; John F.
Jackson, Buffalo, N.Y., bronze medal; Harry C. Starr, Chicago, first
honorable mention (bronze medal); Edward T. Wilder, Chicago, second
honorable mention (bronze medal). L.&nbsp;J. Millet, R.&nbsp;C. Spencer,

societies, schools, and public competitions have proved of unusual
interest to the younger members of the profession, and during the coming
year it is hoped that more importance can be given to this work. The
cooperation of all who are concerned in organizations of this character
is earnestly solicited.</p>

<p>The competitions which have been offered from time to time under the
direction of the magazine have proved so successful that an effort will
be made to establish them as a regular feature, and it is hoped that at
least one competition a month can be looked for in future.</p>

Brochure Series<br>
Competition No. 3.</a></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The designs submitted in the competition closing December 20 for the
advertising page of the Boynton Furnace Co. proved of even greater merit
as a whole than those submitted in the first competition, and it has
been difficult to decide which has the best claim to the prize; but the
judges have finally decided to award the first place to Mr. William L.
Welton, of Lynn, Mass., and his design is given on advertising page xiii
of this number. Of the reasons for this award some will be evident at a
glance. The effect of the page as a whole is striking and unique. To be
sure, there is a certain suggestiveness of Mr. Binner&rsquo;s familiar
advertisements for the Pabst Brewing Co., but the similarity goes no
further than the selection of Egyptian motives and the simple, flat,
silhouette-like treatment. Mr. Welton has merely gone to the same source
of inspiration, and his design is just as good in its way as Mr.
Binner&rsquo;s. The idea of connecting the character of the ornament
with the advertisement is carried out in both cases.
<!-- 195b -->
<!-- png22 -->
The Pabst advertisements all state that the history of brewing begins
with Egypt, while Mr. Welton has very cleverly used the Great Pyramid of
Cheops as a graphic illustration to indicate the area covered by the
heaters built by the Boynton Furnace Company.</p>

<p>If any suggestions were to be offered towards the improvement of this
design, they would be mainly in the direction of refinement in drawing.
The lettering is not what it might be, especially at the top in the name
of the company, which is somewhat confused. The monogram, an unimportant
feature from an advertising point of view, is given the most important
position in the design.</p>

<p>The following competitors, in the opinion of the judges, deserve
honorable mention: W.&nbsp;B. Olmsted, 118 Lake Street, Elmira, N.Y.;
Pierre Liesch, 53 State Street, Boston, Mass.; P.&nbsp;G. Gulbranson, 31
West Street, Boston, Mass.; F.&nbsp;Chouteau Brown, 31 East Newton
Street, Boston, Mass.; William J. Freethy, 85 Water Street, Boston,
Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. Olmsted&rsquo;s design, which is illustrated herewith, is, like
the design which he submitted in the last competition, in many respects
distinctly the best of the collection. It is unfortunate in representing
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<!-- png24 -->
a heater not made by the Boynton Furnace Company, but very suggestive of
a pattern made by one of their competitors in the trade. If it were not
for this unfortunate slip, it would be given first place. The idea is
good and the treatment all that could be desired. It is good advertising
and meets the conditions directly and well.</p>

<p>The design of Mr. Liesch has the virtue of being unusual, and would
arrest the attention of many who might not be attracted by the preceding
one. The lettering in this case, although done with exceptional taste,
is not sufficiently clear and readable to be entirely satisfactory as an
advertisement.</p>

<p>Mr. Gulbranson&rsquo;s design is of more interest as a drawing than
as an advertisement. To the readers of <span class = "smallcaps">The
Brochure Series</span> this characteristic would doubtless appeal, while
it might be of no value in an advertisement intended for a different
clientage.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown&rsquo;s design has an interest of a different sort. It is
crude in treatment, purposely so no doubt, but the idea is so unusual,
with a quaint touch of humor, that it would be sure to attract
attention. If space would allow, several of the remaining designs could
be reproduced to advantage, and would give a wider field for
comparison.</p>

Notes.</a></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Attention has already been called in these columns to the efforts of
the Henry F. Miller Piano Co. to foster the designing of artistic piano
cases. Their later designs are a long step away from the conventional
and hopelessly ugly piano cases that have been put out by the piano
trade universally. They reason that the piano, as an artistic
instrument, should have an artistic setting, and it is to draw the
attention of architectural designers to this point that they have
already given prizes for one competition, and purpose offering another
prize, probably of $100, for a second competition. The making of special
designs for piano cases has fallen largely into the hands of
custom-furniture makers simply because the work of piano factories has
for years carried its own condemnation. The furniture maker often is
forced to buy a new piano, from stock, and build it over as best he can,
charging a price that is almost prohibitory. Since the Miller factory
has been equipped with the best facilities for special case work it has
become possible for architects to have their own designs intelligently
executed without unreasonable expense, or to secure unfinished cases
should they
<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<!-- png27 -->
wish a cabinet maker to execute their designs. The Miller Company is one
of the few piano companies in a position to undertake this departure.
The character of their pianos as superior instruments was established
years ago, and every succeeding year has added to their reputation. The
fight for a front-rank position as instrument makers has been won. Now
they begin to fight for artistic case building, and they deserve the
sympathy and encouragement of every American architect. The work of the
pioneer is always hard, and it is seldom the pioneer who gets the
benefits from this work. Should this move of the Miller Company prove
that better designed cases will be appreciated by the public, every
piano maker in the country will follow suit, but none seem to have the
courage to strike out independently with the same aim. The piano shown
on this page <span class = "recon">is th</span>e Wagner <span class =

SHINGLE STAINED HOUSES.</a></h4>

<p>In this number we present to our readers a class of advertisement
that cannot but prove acceptable, owing to the intrinsic interest of the
subjects published in it. The seven pages preceding our first
frontispiece show an attractive collection of country and suburban
residences by Boston architects. The fact that these residences are
stained with Dexter Brothers&rsquo; English Shingle Stains, which
constitutes the advertising character of the illustrations, adds to
rather than detracts from their value, for each subject is remarkably
satisfactory for its color scheme, and while a photograph does not give
the effect, the selection was made very largely on the basis of good
coloring.</p>

<p>No further word concerning the stains is necessary. The fact that
they have been used on these houses, let alone thousands of others
throughout the country, is sufficient.</p>

<p>The Dalton-Ingersoll Co. have come to the front with an improved
style of lavatory, which presents many new features all in the line of
open fixtures. A&nbsp;cut is shown in their advertisement where a
description of the lavatory is given. The same arguments in favor of the
porcelain, or enameled bath, standing clear of everything, apply with
equal force to the lavatory.</p>

The attention of all readers of <span class = "smallcaps">The Brochure

goods are offered as premiums in the subscription competitions, which
will be found in the advertising pages of this number. None of these
offers have been made without careful personal investigation on our
part, and all the goods we can confidently recommend as strictly
high-class in all respects. Those who may have occasion to make
purchases in any of the various lines represented will do well to look
up this matter. A&nbsp;few moments spent in writing for information may
save much time and money.</p>

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
